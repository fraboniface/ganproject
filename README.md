# ganproject
Applying GANs to Painter by Numbers dataset

This project took place in the Machine Learning Practical course at the University of Edinburgh, where I did my masters.
This repository was only used to store and share code between memmbers of the group and the computing cluster, and was not designed as a real programming project.
Thus, it does not follow the git workflow.
I intended to clean it up an put it in a new repository to make it public, but haven't taken the time to do so yet, which is why I decided to simply publish the original private repository.
